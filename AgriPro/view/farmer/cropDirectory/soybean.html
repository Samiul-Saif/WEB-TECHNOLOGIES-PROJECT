    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>Soybeans are typically grown for their seeds, which are processed into oil, meal, and various food products such as tofu and soy milk. The crop is grown in temperate and tropical regions, with major producers including the United States, Brazil, and Argentina.</p>
    <p>Soybeans are also a key crop in sustainable farming systems due to their nitrogen-fixing ability, which improves soil fertility for subsequent crops.</p>
