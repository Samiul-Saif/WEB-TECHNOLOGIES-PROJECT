    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>Potatoes come in various types, including russet, red, white, yellow, and fingerling, each suited for different culinary purposes. The crop is propagated through tubers rather than seeds and requires careful handling to avoid bruising and sprouting.</p>
    <p>Potato farming can be labor-intensive, especially for smallholder farmers who rely on traditional methods. Mechanized farming is commonly used in developed countries to improve efficiency and yield.</p>
    <p>Major potato-producing countries include China, India, Russia, and the United States. Potatoes are grown in diverse climates, from temperate to subtropical regions.</p>
