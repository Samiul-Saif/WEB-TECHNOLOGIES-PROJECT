    <h1>Sugarcane</h1>
    <p>Sugarcane is a tropical grass that is primarily grown for its high sucrose content, which is processed into sugar and other products. It is a major agricultural crop in tropical and subtropical regions and plays a significant role in the global sugar industry.</p>

    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>Sugarcane is a major source of biofuels, particularly ethanol, and is also used in the production of molasses, rum, and jaggery. It requires a warm tropical or subtropical climate for optimal growth and is typically planted using stem cuttings rather than seeds.</p>
    <p>In addition to its use in sugar production, sugarcane is also utilized in various industrial applications, such as paper production and construction materials in some regions.</p>
