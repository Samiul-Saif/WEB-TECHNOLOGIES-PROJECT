    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>Maize is available in several types, including sweet corn, dent corn, flint corn, and popcorn, each serving different purposes. It is used in making tortillas, cornbread, animal feed, ethanol, and even biodegradable plastics.</p>
    <p>Maize cultivation is highly mechanized in many countries, which has significantly increased productivity. However, smallholder farmers in developing nations still rely on traditional methods.</p>
    <p>Major maize-producing countries include the United States, China, Brazil, and India. It is grown extensively in tropical and temperate regions worldwide.</p>
