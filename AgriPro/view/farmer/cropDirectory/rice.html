    <h2>Additional Information</h2>
    <p>Rice varieties are broadly categorized into two types: upland rice and lowland rice. Upland rice is grown in dry fields, while lowland rice is cultivated in flooded areas.</p>
    <p>Rice is rich in carbohydrates and provides essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and amino acids. It is used in various forms, including white rice, brown rice, and parboiled rice, catering to different culinary traditions worldwide.</p>
    <p>Major rice-producing countries include China, India, Indonesia, and Bangladesh. Advanced agricultural practices, such as mechanized planting and harvesting, have significantly improved rice yields in these regions.</p>
